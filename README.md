# MSSAPractice
The idea is to build a flash-card app for studying basic C# concepts to both learn how to use them and help
our classmates study. This app will contain many of the keywords in C# (static, private, virtual, etc.) 
and demonstrate codeas well as contain links to where you can learn more about those topics. As topics are 
learned, we will update the app with more information.

To start with, we will create a single executable that runs on desktop computers.
The app will contain a button for starting and will randomly display keyword cards.
When the 'flip' button is pressed the card will switch to the definition of the topic.
The cards will have a 'next card' button to select another random card.
